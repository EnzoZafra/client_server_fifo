# CMPUT 379 Assignment 2 Phase 1

## Project Status
As of submission, the restricted program (a2rchat) provides all of the functionality given in the
assignment for phase 1.

Since the client is only needed to echo the message back from the server, I am not polling
the STDIN for the client but rather, reading STDIN and then polling the file descriptors of the
outFIFOs.

There was a strange error that caused the server to exit because it is not able to open the corresponding
outFIFO. I was not able to replicate the bug.

There was also an error that the poll() done by the server is reading the STDOUT of the client in
very rare cases. (e.g. The client will printf() the message received from server -> client but the
message is seen in the server process instead.) This problem was mostly seen when running the 'close'
command in the client.

## How to run
To run the server:
`./a2rchat -s [fifo name] [num clients]`

To run the client
`./a2rchat -c [fifo name]`
